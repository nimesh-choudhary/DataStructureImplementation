Graph - It is a combination of vertex and egde where vertex is a node and edge is a connection between two 2 vertex.

Path - In path it means when all the nodes are reachable. In the path the each node appears once not twice
and adjacent node should be connected with edge.
1->2->3->4, 
2->5->6
so if I tell 1->5->6 then it is not a path. Because we can't go directly from 1 to 5 because there is no edge between 1 and 5


Degree of a Graph - It means the node is connected with how many node or number of node attached with one node (this definition will be true for only undirected graph)


1->2->3
2->4
2->5 

it means 2 is connected with 1,3,4,5 so it has 4 degree.

so to find the total degree of a undirected graph is 2*E where E is number of edges.


So for directed graph we have two things 1 is Indegree and 2 is Outdegree. 
So Indegree means number of nodes are incoming
Outdegree means number of nodes are going from a node.


So if we didn't define the weight in weighted directed graph then we will considered as 1 its weight.
